# CUDA PROJECTS
## Introduction
This repository contains CUDA projects focusing on optimizing different algorithms for GPU execution. Additionally, it includes a `gpuProp.cu` file that provides GPU properties to customize parameters for the kernels in these projects.

## Projects

1. Optimizing Convolution
2. Matrix Multiplication (Matmul)
3. Reduction
4. Transpose

## Usage
* Navigate to desired project directory and follow instructions\
